in dBank, add password feature to withdraw money
	make sure they don't claim money again and again. Dont allow contracts to call functions. Make sure tx.origin == msg.sender
	reduce money from balance first, then try to send money. If it fails, add money back to balance
	same for TODO-app
	emit events when money is withdrawn
if forgot password, give user a seed phrase, or two 16-character one-time recovery keys for emergency recovery,
	or security questions like birth place, mother's maiden name, etc
for withdraw by other person, decide whose password to use to withdraw
handle case if private key is theft, no balance for gas fee, and also forgot password.
think of 2fa or TOTP
	if that fails, give option to reset 2fa using recovery key, or security questions
	search for solidity totp
think of using web3Auth.io
