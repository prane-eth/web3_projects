# Sample Hardhat Project


Advantages of this project:
- Privacy: transactions happen with the smart contract and not with the wallet of other user.
- Security: if your private key is compromised, the attackers will not know there is a balance here.
- Gas cost: you can save gas with a transfer to other DeBank account instead of to wallet.


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

If your private keys is compromised and attackers stole all balance, you can withdraw balance using authorized addresses.
